## 🚀 Why This Exists

ZeroGrav is designed to bridge the gap between generic chat responses and production-ready output. Every prompt is engineered to be **tactical**, **repeatable**, and **context-aware**.

- **High-Signal Prompting**: Structured payloads that produce implementation-ready code and designs.
- **Efficient Discovery**: Instant search, category filtering, and one-click share controls.
- **Zero Friction**: Modal-based detail views minimize navigation and keep you in the flow.

## ✨ Key Features

- **100+ Engineered Prompts**: Covering 10 critical categories including UX, Performance, and Accessibility.
- **One-Click Workflows**: Copy and share prompts individually or share the entire vault.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Glassmorphic UI with responsive typography and micro-animations.
- **Veteran-First Design**: Integrated support for US Military Veterans via [VeteranClaimBuilder.com](https://veteranclaimbuilder.com).
