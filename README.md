## 🚀 Why This Exists

Most prompts are vague, one-shot afterthoughts — and the output shows it. ZeroGrav is a curated vault of **250 production-grade prompts** built for people who ship with AI, not just chat with it.

- **Copy. Paste. Ship.** Every prompt is a complete, structured payload — not a starting point you have to fix. Paste it, get implementation-ready output on the first try.
- **Find what you need in seconds.** Instant search, category filter pills, and one-click copy — no docs to read, no setup, no login.
- **Built for the way vibe coders actually work.** Modal-based detail views keep you in flow. Open a card, grab the prompt, close it, keep building.

## ✨ Key Features

- **250 Engineered Prompts**: Covering 10 critical categories including UX, Performance, and Accessibility.
- **One-Click Workflows**: Copy and share prompts individually or share the entire vault.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Glassmorphic UI with responsive typography and micro-animations.
